# Spirituality Dimensions Benchmark

> **Purpose:** Define what life dimensions should exist in `smind_life_dimensions` to comprehensively cover Spirituality — meaning, purpose, inner life, values, and philosophical grounding.
>
> **Consumer:** The Evaluator job reads this benchmark and grades actual dimensions against it.
>
> **Version:** 1.0 (2026-02-20) — initial benchmark.

## How to Use This Benchmark

Each section below defines a **required coverage area**. For each area, the benchmark specifies:

- **What it covers** — scope definition
- **Why it matters** — justification for inclusion
- **Minimum coverage criteria** — what the Evaluator should check for

A dimension in `smind_life_dimensions` satisfies an area if its `name` + `description` clearly map to the scope described. One dimension may cover multiple sub-areas if its description is broad enough, but vague catch-all dimensions (e.g., just "Spirituality") do NOT satisfy specific sub-areas.

---

## Required Coverage Areas

### 1. Purpose & Meaning

**What it covers:** The individual's sense of why they exist, what makes life worth living, what they are "here to do." Includes life mission, calling, ikigai-type frameworks, and existential direction.

**Why it matters:** Purpose is the anchor of spiritual life. Without a dimension tracking it, goals around meaning-making have nowhere to attach.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension explicitly addresses life purpose, meaning, or existential direction.
- The dimension description must go beyond generic "well-being" — it should specifically reference purpose, meaning, mission, or calling.

---

### 2. Personal Values & Ethics

**What it covers:** Clarity about one's core values, moral principles, ethical commitments, and integrity. Includes values identification, values-action alignment, and ethical reasoning.

**Why it matters:** Values are the decision-making compass. Tracking values clarity enables goals around living consistently with what one believes.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension explicitly addresses personal values, ethics, or moral principles.
- Should reference values clarity, alignment between stated values and behavior, or ethical framework.

---

### 3. Mindfulness & Present-Moment Awareness

**What it covers:** Capacity for non-judgmental present-moment awareness. Includes meditation practice, contemplative habits, attention training, and the ability to observe one's own mental states.

**Why it matters:** Mindfulness is a foundational spiritual practice across traditions. It is also empirically linked to well-being and self-regulation.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension covers mindfulness, meditation, contemplative practice, or present-moment awareness.
- Must not be collapsed into generic "mental health" — the contemplative/attentional aspect must be explicit.

---

### 4. Gratitude & Appreciation

**What it covers:** The practice and disposition of recognizing and appreciating what is good in one's life. Includes gratitude journaling, savoring, and cultivating appreciation as a habit.

**Why it matters:** Gratitude is one of the most robustly studied positive psychology interventions and a core element of many spiritual traditions.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension explicitly addresses gratitude, appreciation, or thankfulness as a practice or disposition.
- Can be part of a broader "positive inner states" dimension if gratitude is explicitly named in the description.

---

### 5. Existential Reflection & Self-Examination

**What it covers:** Regular engagement with deep questions about mortality, suffering, freedom, identity, and the human condition. Includes journaling, philosophical inquiry, memento mori practices, and honest self-assessment.

**Why it matters:** Without existential reflection, spirituality becomes shallow. This area ensures the life model includes space for confronting hard questions rather than avoiding them.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension covers existential reflection, philosophical self-examination, or engagement with fundamental life questions.
- Must reference specific existential themes (mortality, suffering, freedom, identity) or the practice of deep self-inquiry — not just "thinking about life."

---

### 6. Personal Philosophy & Worldview

**What it covers:** The coherent (or evolving) framework through which the individual interprets reality. Includes religious beliefs, secular philosophies, metaphysical positions, epistemological commitments, and worldview construction.

**Why it matters:** Everyone operates from a worldview whether articulated or not. Tracking this dimension enables goals around worldview coherence, intellectual honesty, and philosophical development.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension addresses personal philosophy, worldview, belief systems, or metaphysical/epistemological orientation.
- Must not require religiosity — secular philosophical frameworks count equally.

---

### 7. Inner Peace & Equanimity

**What it covers:** The capacity to maintain emotional equilibrium in the face of adversity, uncertainty, and change. Includes equanimity, acceptance, non-reactivity, surrender, and letting go.

**Why it matters:** Inner peace is both a goal and a practice in virtually every spiritual tradition. It is distinct from happiness (which is hedonic) — equanimity is about stability regardless of external conditions.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension explicitly addresses inner peace, equanimity, acceptance, or emotional stability in a spiritual (not purely clinical) context.
- Must be distinguishable from mental health treatment — the emphasis is on cultivated inner stability, not absence of pathology.

---

### 8. Transcendence & Awe

**What it covers:** Experiences of self-transcendence, awe, wonder, flow states, mystical experiences, and connection to something larger than the self. Includes nature-based awe, artistic transcendence, psychedelic experiences (if relevant), peak experiences, and the numinous.

**Why it matters:** Transcendent experiences are a core feature of spiritual life across cultures. They are also linked to prosocial behavior, humility, and perspective-broadening.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension covers transcendence, awe, wonder, or peak/mystical experiences.
- Must go beyond "feels good" — should reference self-transcendence, connection to something larger, or the experience of the numinous/sublime.

---

### 9. Compassion & Lovingkindness (Self & Others)

**What it covers:** The cultivation of compassion, lovingkindness, empathy, and forgiveness — directed both inward (self-compassion) and outward (compassion for others). Includes metta practice, forgiveness work, and empathic development.

**Why it matters:** Compassion is central to virtually every spiritual and ethical tradition. Self-compassion is empirically critical for sustainable inner work.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension explicitly addresses compassion, lovingkindness, forgiveness, or empathy as a spiritual practice.
- Should cover both self-directed and other-directed compassion (can be one dimension if description is explicit about both).

---

### 10. Connection to Nature & the Living World

**What it covers:** The felt relationship between the individual and the natural world. Includes ecological awareness, nature immersion as spiritual practice, biophilia, and stewardship.

**Why it matters:** Nature connection is a major source of awe, grounding, and perspective. Many spiritual traditions center the human-nature relationship. Ignoring it leaves a gap in holistic spirituality coverage.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension addresses nature connection, ecological spirituality, or the human-nature relationship.
- Can be combined with transcendence/awe if nature is explicitly named, but standalone coverage is preferred.

---

### 11. Ritual, Practice & Discipline

**What it covers:** The structured practices that anchor spiritual life — prayer, meditation routines, ceremonies, liturgy, sabbath-keeping, pilgrimage, fasting, or any regularly repeated practice intended to cultivate spiritual growth.

**Why it matters:** Spirituality without practice is abstraction. This area tracks whether the individual has (or is developing) concrete spiritual disciplines, not just beliefs or feelings.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension covers spiritual practices, rituals, disciplines, or routines.
- Must reference specific practice types or the general concept of structured spiritual discipline — not just "being spiritual."

---

### 12. Spiritual Community & Belonging

**What it covers:** Connection to others who share spiritual seeking — sangha, congregation, study groups, spiritual friendships, mentors/teachers, or online spiritual communities. Includes both organized religion and informal spiritual companionship.

**Why it matters:** Spiritual development in isolation is fragile. Community provides accountability, teaching, shared practice, and belonging. This is commonly overlooked in individualistic frameworks.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension addresses spiritual community, fellowship, sangha, mentorship, or shared spiritual practice.
- Must be distinguishable from generic "social life" — the spiritual/seeking dimension of the community must be explicit.

---

### 13. Shadow Work & Integration

**What it covers:** Engagement with disowned, repressed, or unconscious aspects of the self. Includes Jungian shadow work, trauma integration (as spiritual practice, not clinical treatment), confronting personal darkness, and integrating difficult emotions.

**Why it matters:** Spirituality that only focuses on light/positive states is incomplete and potentially harmful (spiritual bypassing). Shadow work ensures the model includes the difficult inner work that produces genuine transformation.

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension addresses shadow work, psychological integration, confronting inner darkness, or working with difficult/repressed material.
- Must be framed in a growth/integration context, not a clinical/pathological one.

---

### 14. Surrender, Trust & Faith

**What it covers:** The capacity to let go of control, trust the process of life, and hold faith (secular or religious). Includes surrender to uncertainty, trust in oneself or a higher power, and the courage to proceed without guarantees.

**Why it matters:** Control-seeking is a major obstacle to spiritual growth. This area tracks the often-overlooked dimension of letting go, which is distinct from both equanimity (state) and practice (behavior).

**Minimum coverage criteria:**
- At least one dimension addresses surrender, trust, faith, or letting go of control.
- Can overlap with inner peace/equanimity but must specifically reference the active process of releasing control or trusting, not just the resulting state.

---

## Completeness Checklist

For the Evaluator: the `smind_life_dimensions` table has **comprehensive Spirituality coverage** if and only if ALL 14 areas above have at least one matching dimension. Partial coverage should be scored proportionally (e.g., 10/14 = 71%).

## Known Edge Cases & Clarifications

- **Overlap with Mental Health:** Mindfulness, equanimity, and self-compassion also appear in psychological frameworks. The key differentiator is framing: spiritual dimensions should reference these as practices of inner cultivation, not clinical interventions.
- **Overlap with Social/Relationships:** Spiritual community overlaps with social life. The Evaluator should check that the spiritual seeking/practice aspect is explicit, not just "has friends."
- **Secular spirituality:** This benchmark is tradition-agnostic. Secular humanism, philosophical naturalism, and non-theistic frameworks satisfy these areas equally. No dimension should require religious belief.
- **Cultural breadth:** The benchmark draws from multiple traditions (Buddhist mindfulness, Christian contemplation, Stoic equanimity, Jungian shadow work, indigenous nature connection, etc.). Dimensions need not name traditions but should be broad enough to encompass them.
