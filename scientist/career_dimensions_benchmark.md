## How to Use This Benchmark

Each **Required Area** below represents a distinct facet of Career that should be covered by at least one life dimension (row in `smind_life_dimensions`). A dimension "covers" an area when its `name` + `description` clearly address the area's scope.

- A single dimension may cover more than one area if its description is explicit about both.
- An area is **missing** if no dimension's description substantively addresses it.
- An area is **weak** if a dimension touches it only tangentially or vaguely.

## Required Areas

### 1. Professional Identity & Direction

**What it covers:** Clarity about professional identity — who you are professionally, what kind of work you want to be known for, what career archetype or path you're pursuing.

**Why it matters:** Without a clear professional identity, skill-building and networking lack direction. This is the "north star" dimension.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension exist that addresses career vision, professional identity, or long-term career direction?

---

### 2. Core Technical / Domain Skills

**What it covers:** The primary hard skills and domain expertise required for the person's current or target role. Includes depth of knowledge, staying current with the field, and technical competence.

**Why it matters:** This is the foundation of professional value. Skill atrophy is a real risk, especially in fast-moving fields.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension exist that addresses maintaining and growing the primary technical or domain skills for the person's profession?

---

### 3. Meta-Skills & Transferable Competencies

**What it covers:** Skills that transcend any single role — communication, leadership, problem-solving, critical thinking, project management, negotiation, writing, public speaking, decision-making under uncertainty.

**Why it matters:** These amplify domain skills and are the main differentiator at senior levels. Often neglected by technically-oriented people.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension exist for cross-cutting professional competencies distinct from core domain skills?

---

### 4. Learning & Professional Development

**What it covers:** Active investment in learning — courses, certifications, conferences, reading, mentorship (as mentee), deliberate practice, staying current with industry trends.

**Why it matters:** Career longevity depends on continuous learning. This is the *process* of growth, not the *state* of skills.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address ongoing learning habits, professional development activities, or knowledge acquisition?

---

### 5. Job / Role Satisfaction

**What it covers:** Day-to-day satisfaction with current work — engagement, meaning, autonomy, challenge level, alignment between values and daily tasks, psychological safety at work.

**Why it matters:** Satisfaction is a leading indicator of burnout, attrition, and career pivots. Ignoring it leads to crisis-driven career changes.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address satisfaction, fulfillment, or engagement with current work?

---

### 6. Compensation & Financial Trajectory

**What it covers:** Salary, equity, benefits, earning trajectory, market positioning of compensation, negotiation leverage, understanding of personal market value.

**Why it matters:** Compensation is a concrete career outcome and a major life constraint. Under-earning relative to market value compounds over a career.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address compensation, earning potential, or financial aspects of career?

---

### 7. Professional Network & Relationships

**What it covers:** Quality and breadth of professional network — mentors, peers, industry contacts, weak ties, community involvement, professional reputation within a network.

**Why it matters:** Opportunities (jobs, partnerships, knowledge) flow through networks. Network quality is one of the strongest predictors of career outcomes.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address professional networking, industry relationships, or professional community?

---

### 8. Career Strategy & Planning

**What it covers:** Intentional career planning — having a roadmap, evaluating opportunities against long-term goals, understanding career leverage points, timing of moves, risk assessment of career decisions.

**Why it matters:** Reactive career management (waiting for opportunities) underperforms deliberate strategy. Most people never explicitly plan.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address career planning, strategy, or deliberate career decision-making?

---

### 9. Work Environment & Conditions

**What it covers:** Physical and organizational work environment — remote vs. in-office, team dynamics, management quality, organizational culture, tools and infrastructure, commute, ergonomics.

**Why it matters:** Environment strongly affects productivity and satisfaction but is often treated as fixed rather than a variable to optimize.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address work environment, workplace conditions, or organizational context?

---

### 10. Work-Life Integration

**What it covers:** The boundary (or deliberate lack thereof) between professional and personal life — time allocation, energy management, sustainable pace, ability to disconnect, impact of work on relationships and health.

**Why it matters:** This is the interface between Career and other life dimensions. Poor integration degrades both career performance and life quality.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address the relationship between work demands and personal life, or sustainable work practices?

---

### 11. Side Projects & Entrepreneurial Activity

**What it covers:** Professional activities outside the primary job — side projects, freelancing, open-source contributions, consulting, startup exploration, portfolio/hobby projects with professional value.

**Why it matters:** Side projects build skills, expand networks, create optionality, and can become primary income sources. They're a distinct career vector from the main job.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address side projects, entrepreneurial pursuits, or professional work outside the main job?

---

### 12. Professional Reputation & Personal Brand

**What it covers:** How the person is perceived professionally — online presence, thought leadership, public speaking, publications, social media professional presence, portfolio visibility, industry recognition.

**Why it matters:** Reputation is a compounding asset. It opens doors passively and is increasingly important in knowledge-work careers.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address professional reputation, personal brand, or public professional visibility?

---

### 13. Mentorship & Knowledge Sharing (as Provider)

**What it covers:** Teaching, mentoring others, knowledge sharing within teams or communities — distinct from *receiving* mentorship (which falls under Learning).

**Why it matters:** Teaching deepens understanding, builds reputation, and creates reciprocal relationships. It's also a signal of seniority and leadership.

**Concrete check:** Does a dimension address mentoring others, teaching, or professional knowledge sharing?

## Edge Cases & Commonly Overlooked Areas

These don't necessarily require dedicated dimensions but should be covered *somewhere* in the dimension set:

| Area | Should be covered by | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| Career transitions / pivots | Career Strategy & Planning | Explicit pivot planning, not just linear advancement |
| Freelance / independent work | Side Projects & Entrepreneurial Activity | If relevant to the person |
| Industry / market awareness | Learning & Professional Development | Understanding where the industry is heading |
| Credentials & certifications | Learning & Professional Development | Formal qualifications |
| Interview & job search skills | Meta-Skills | Includes resume, portfolio, interviewing |
| Burnout prevention | Work-Life Integration + Job Satisfaction | Cross-cutting concern |
| Workplace politics & influence | Meta-Skills + Work Environment | Navigating organizational dynamics |
| Remote work effectiveness | Work Environment & Conditions | Increasingly important sub-area |

## Scoring Guidance for Evaluator

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **Full coverage** | All 13 required areas are addressed by at least one dimension with clear, specific descriptions |
| **Good coverage** | 10-12 areas covered; gaps are minor or edge-case |
| **Partial coverage** | 7-9 areas covered; notable blind spots |
| **Poor coverage** | Fewer than 7 areas covered |

A dimension with a vague description like "career stuff" should NOT count as covering multiple areas. Descriptions must be specific enough to clearly map to the required areas.

*Benchmark produced by Career Scientist. Next run should: refine area boundaries, add examples of good vs. bad dimension descriptions, consider career-stage-specific areas (early career vs. senior vs. executive).*
