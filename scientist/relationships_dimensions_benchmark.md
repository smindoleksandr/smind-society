# Relationships Dimensions Benchmark v1.0.0

What comprehensive life-dimension coverage looks like for **Relationships** — interpersonal connections including partner, family, friends, social life, and dependents (including pets).

This benchmark defines the **areas** that must be represented by dimensions in `smind_life_dimensions`. It does NOT prescribe exact dimension IDs or names. An Evaluator will compare actual dimensions against this benchmark and flag coverage gaps.

## Scope Boundary

**In scope:** Any life dimension whose primary concern is an interpersonal relationship, social bond, caregiving responsibility, or community connection.

**Out of scope:** Intrapersonal wellbeing (mental health, self-care), career networking done purely for professional advancement (belongs to Career), and physical health of the user themselves. However, *emotional health as it relates to relationship quality* is in scope.

---

## Required Coverage Areas

Each area below must be covered by at least one dimension (either as a standalone dimension or clearly within the scope of a broader one). The Evaluator should check that every area is addressable — meaning a goal or scheduling block targeting that area would have a natural home.

### A1 — Romantic Partnership / Intimate Relationship

- Current partner relationship quality, maintenance, investment.
- Dating and partner search (if applicable).
- Conflict resolution and communication within the partnership.
- Shared planning (finances, living situation, future goals as a couple).
- Physical and emotional intimacy.
- **Edge case:** Polyamorous or non-traditional relationship structures should not be excluded by dimension naming.

### A2 — Family of Origin

- Relationships with parents, siblings, and extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents).
- Obligation management (visits, calls, cultural/religious duties).
- Family conflict and boundary-setting.
- Caregiving for aging parents or family members with special needs.
- **Edge case:** Estranged family — dimension should accommodate "managing distance" as a valid relationship state, not assume closeness.

### A3 — Children and Parenting

- Raising children (if applicable): daily care, education involvement, emotional support.
- Co-parenting dynamics (if separated/divorced).
- Planning for future children (if relevant).
- **Edge case:** Stepchildren, adopted children, godchildren, mentored youth — the dimension should not be limited to biological children.

### A4 — Friendships

- Close/deep friendships: maintenance, investment, reciprocity.
- Casual/acquaintance-level friendships and social circle breadth.
- Making new friends (especially after relocation, life transitions).
- Long-distance friendship maintenance.
- Friendship lifecycle: drifting apart, reconnecting, ending toxic friendships.
- **Edge case:** Online-only friendships are valid and should be coverable.

### A5 — Social Life and Community

- Social activities: gatherings, events, parties, group hobbies.
- Community belonging: clubs, religious/spiritual groups, neighborhoods, cultural communities.
- Volunteer work and civic engagement as relationship-building.
- Loneliness and social isolation as a gap indicator.
- **Edge case:** Introverts may have minimal social life by choice — the dimension should support "intentionally small social circle" as a valid state.

### A6 — Dependents: Pets and Animal Companions

- Daily care: feeding, exercise, veterinary health.
- Emotional bond and companionship quality.
- Training and behavioral management.
- End-of-life planning and grief.
- Multi-pet household dynamics.
- **Edge case:** Non-traditional pets (reptiles, fish, birds) have different care profiles but are still dependents.

### A7 — Professional/Workplace Relationships

- Relationships with colleagues, managers, direct reports — *as interpersonal bonds*, not career strategy.
- Mentorship (giving and receiving).
- Navigating office politics and interpersonal conflict at work.
- Work-life boundary as it affects relationship energy.
- **Overlap note:** Career dimensions may also address workplace relationships from a professional-advancement angle. The Relationships dimension covers the *interpersonal quality* side.

### A8 — Conflict Resolution and Relationship Repair

- Cross-cutting skill area: applies to partner, family, friends, colleagues.
- Active conflicts and their resolution status.
- Forgiveness, grudges, and emotional processing.
- Knowing when to disengage vs. repair.
- **Note:** This may be embedded within other areas rather than standalone. The Evaluator should check that conflict resolution is addressable *somewhere*, not necessarily as its own dimension.

### A9 — Communication Quality

- Cross-cutting: general communication skills and habits across all relationships.
- Frequency and quality of contact with important people.
- Active listening, vulnerability, emotional expression.
- Digital communication hygiene (response times, platform management).
- **Note:** Like A8, may be embedded rather than standalone. Must be addressable somewhere.

### A10 — Relationship with Self (Interpersonal Context)

- Attachment style awareness and how it affects relationships.
- Boundaries: ability to set and maintain them across all relationship types.
- People-pleasing patterns, codependency, or avoidance.
- **Scope note:** This is NOT general mental health — it's specifically self-knowledge as it impacts interpersonal functioning. General self-care/mental-health belongs elsewhere.

## Completeness Checklist

The Evaluator should verify:

1. **All 10 areas (A1–A10) are addressable** — each has at least one dimension that could house goals or schedules for it.
2. **No major relationship type is homeless** — if someone has a relationship concern, there's a dimension for it.
3. **Both maintenance and crisis are covered** — dimensions shouldn't only address "healthy relationship upkeep" but also conflict, loss, grief, estrangement.
4. **Lifecycle coverage** — relationship formation (meeting people), deepening, maintenance, deterioration, and ending are all representable.
5. **Caregiving is explicit** — for aging parents, children, and pets. These carry scheduling and energy implications distinct from "quality time."
6. **Cross-cutting skills (A8, A9, A10) are addressable** — even if folded into broader dimensions rather than standalone.

## Anti-Patterns

The Evaluator should flag these as problems:

- **Partner-only bias:** Relationships coverage that only addresses romantic partnership and ignores friends, family, community.
- **Happy-path only:** Dimensions that assume all relationships are positive; no coverage for conflict, estrangement, grief, or toxic dynamics.
- **Missing dependents:** Pets and animal companions omitted entirely.
- **Vague catch-all:** A single "relationships" dimension with no sub-structure, making it impossible to set targeted goals.
- **Activity-as-dimension:** "Weekly dinner with parents" is a scheduling block, not a dimension. Dimensions should be durable life areas.

## Scoring Guidance for Evaluator

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Full coverage** | All 10 areas addressable, no anti-patterns present |
| **Good coverage** | 7–9 areas addressable, at most 1 anti-pattern |
| **Partial coverage** | 4–6 areas addressable, or 2+ anti-patterns |
| **Poor coverage** | ≤3 areas addressable, or vague catch-all only |
